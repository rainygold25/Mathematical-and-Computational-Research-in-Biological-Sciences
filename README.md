# Personal Genomics & Early Disease Detection

**Precision Genomics for Predictive Healthcare: A Computational Pipeline for Mutation Discovery and Early Diagnosis**

***

## Project Overview

This repository delivers a groundbreaking, end-to-end genomics analytics pipeline built during the UChicago Summer Immersion program. Leveraging modern bioinformatics, machine learning, and variant annotation tools, this project empowers clinicians and researchers with actionable insights on individual genetic risk factors and enables early detection of critical diseases. This work exemplifies technical excellence, scientific rigor, and vision—precisely what top-tier organizations like Tesla seek in transformative talent.

## Abstract

Genomic medicine is reshaping human health, but actionable mutation discovery requires scale, accuracy, and interpretability. This project processed high-throughput sequencing data to identify 215,729 variants (148,361 high-quality) across all human chromosomes, including 13,418 key exonic mutations, enabling new avenues for targeted diagnosis and precision treatment. From variant alignment to annotation and disease mapping, this work showcases the future of individualized medicine.

## Pipeline Components

- **Sequence Alignment:**  
  Utilizes BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) for efficient mapping of raw sequence reads to the human reference genome. Multi-threading and read trimming optimizations accelerate computational throughput for real-world datasets.
  
- **Genotyping & Variant Calling:**  
  Employs SAMtools for robust variant identification and genotyping across all 23 chromosomes, with customizable filtering for high-confidence calls (Phred > 50).

- **Annotation:**  
  Integrates ANNOVAR for in-depth annotation, using reference databases (RefGene, SNP, GWAS Catalog, ClinVar) to map mutations to known phenotypes and disease risks.

- **Pathogenic Variant Prioritization:**  
  Extracts and ranks clinically relevant mutations for impact studies on Bardet-Biedl syndrome, progressive familial heart block, severe combined immunodeficiency, and more.
